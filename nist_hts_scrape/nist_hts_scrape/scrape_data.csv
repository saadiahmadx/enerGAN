<strong>Notes:</strong> ""The coprecipitation of the cations as oxalates... was carried out as follows:  Depending on the composition of the desired oxidic compounds 1.864-1.980 g (0.0040-0.00425 mol) Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Merck, extra pure) 0.568-0.758 g  (0.015-0.0020 mol) Pb(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>·3H<sub>2</sub>O (Merck, &gt;99.5%), 0.885-2.067 g  (0.006-0.014 mol) SrCO<sub>3</sub> (Merck, pure), 0.601-1.401 g (0.006-0.014 mol)  CaCO<sub>3</sub> (Merck, volumetric standard), and 2.994 g (0.015 mol) Cu(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O (Merck, &gt;99%) were dissolved in 25 vol.% acetic acid.  The poor solubility of CaCO<sub>3</sub> and SrCO<sub>3</sub> in concentrated acetic acid  necessitated this step.  After evaporation to dryness the residue was dissolved in 200 mL of concentrated acetic acid.  In a typical experiment 200 mL of the solution were added dropwise into 100 mL of a solution containing  6.816 g (0.0541 mol) of oxalic acid... in concentrated acetic acid.  The  mixture was stirred for another hour and kept overnight.  The filter cake was  washed twice with 50 mL of concentrated acetic acid and then dried at 80 °C  for 20 h.  The oxalate powders were first calcined for 20 h at 400 °C and then  for 20 h at 800 °C in air.  The heating and cooling rates were 1 K/min in all experiments.  The powders were milled in an agate mortar.  The powders  were compressed under (0.7 GPa = 7000 bar) into pellets of 13 mm diameter and a thickness of 1 mm... the pellets... were either sintered in air at 840 °C for  96 h or at 850 °C for 72 h or at 860 °C for 48 h.""<br>

""The samples... were prepared... by a conventional solid-state reaction technique. Stoichiometric amounts of high purity compounds, BaCO<sub>3</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Pr<sub>6</sub>O<sub>11</sub> and CuO were thoroughly mixed and pelletised.  The samples were calcined several times. For x ≥ 0.5, the calcination temperature was 950 °C and for x &lt; 0.5, it was 900 °C... Final heat treatment was given in a flowing oxygen atmosphere at the respective calcination temperatures and the pellets were allowed to stay at 500 °C for 12 h while cooling.""<br>

        <strong>Notes:</strong> ""Samples were pepared, using the controlled vapour-solid reaction technique  by heating a precursor pellet of Ba<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>x</sub> and a composite Hg  source together in an evacuated quartz tube.  The precursor pellets were  prepared by heating and drying an aqueous solution of appropriate amounts of  Ba(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O and Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·3H<sub>2</sub>O up to 620 °C in a  beaker.  The resulting black mixture was then ground, compacted and sintered  in flowing oxygen at 900 °C for 24 h to 48 h in an alumina crucible. ... Some  of the pellets were pulverized, thoroughly mixed with HgO and compacted (in a  glove bag) to form the composite Hg source (prereacted  HgBa<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>x</sub>).  A small precursor pellet and a large compsite Hg  source (in a ratio of about 1/3) were sealed in an evacuated quartz tube,  heated to 850 °C and kept at this temperature for 5 h before cooling to  room temperature.  The Hg-1223 pellets were finally heated at 300 °C in  flowing oxygen for 10 h.  X-ray diffraction revealed that about 90% of a  pellet was Hg-1223 and the remaining approximately 10% was a mixture of  CaHgO<sub>2</sub>, Ba<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5.9</sub> and BaCuO<sub>2</sub>,  Both orthorhombic and tetragonal  Hg-1223, with a similar T<sub>c</sub>, were obtained.""<br>

        <strong>Notes:</strong> ""The YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-δ</sub> crystals were grown using a ""self-flux"" technique.   First, stoichiometric amounts of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, BaCO<sub>3</sub>, and CuO were ground and  sintered at 900 °C for 4 days with 3 intermediate grindings to form a  polycrystalline precursor of YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-δ</sub>.  Next, the precursor was  mixed with extra BaCO<sub>3</sub> and CuO in a molar ratio of 1:7:21 to form a flux.   Finally, the mixture was placed in yttria-stabilized zirconia trays, heated  slowly to 980 °C, cooled from 980 °C to 880 °C to room temperature at 100 °C  per hour.  This process yielded flat platelets of YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-δ</sub> single  crystals embedded in the flux, approximately 1 mm x 1 mm x 100 µm in size,  which were removed mechanically from the crucible.  The crystals were then  annealed in gold crucibles in a tube furnace at 420 °C for 10 days, under  flowing high-purity oxygen, in order to fully oxygenate the crystals  (δ about 0.05). ... The crystals were then detwinned... A uniaxial pressure  of about 10<sup>8</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup> was carefully applied to the crystal with a spring.   The displacement of the spring was measured with a calibrated micrometer head  attached to the press.  The crystal under pressure was annealed at  temperatures between 450 °C and 490°C for several hours.  Preheated oxygen  gas was supplied through a capillary quartz tube to maintain the oxygen  content of the single crystal during the detwinning process.  The uniaxial  stress and oxygen supply were maintained as the crystal was cooled at 4 °C  per minute to room temperature.""<br>

The  final calcination was performed for 24 h at 920 °C in air.  Tracer diffusion  measurements are meaningful only if the sample porosity is not connected.  Therefore, a final densification was performed by sinter forging in air at  920 °C to a strain of (about) 50%.  The resultant specimen was over 90% of  theoretical density...

Volatile Tl<sub>2</sub>O  from the powder reacts with the precursor film to form the  Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> phase... The films were patterned using standard  photolithographic techniques. Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) resist (KTI  497 K) was spun onto the wafer and baked at 170 °C.  Then positive photoresist  (Shipley 1400-17) was spun onto the wafer and baked at 90 °C.  Photolithographic transfer from the chromium contact mask to the wafer was  performed with UV light.  The positive photoresist was developed, and the wafer was rinsed in distilled water.  At this point, the remaining positive  photoresist serves as a contact mask for the underlying PMMA.  Following  plasma descumming, deep UV radiation was used to unlink the unprotected PMMA,  which was then dissolved with toluene.  Ion milling of the exposed  Tl<sub>2</sub>Ba<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> film was carried out with a 400 eV argon ion beam at  normal incidence.  The remaining PMMA and photoresist was removed by plasma etching.  Photoresist was spun onto the wafer, the wafer was diced, and the  photoresist was chemically stripped in acetone and isopropanol.  Silver pads  were deposited by sputter deposition through shadow masks, followed by annealing in flowing oxygen at 500 °C... The HTS chips were then mounted on  printed circuit boards, and the silver contacts were attached to the board  through wirebonding gold wire.""<br>

                        <strong>Notes:</strong> ""BSLC (x=0.3) thin films were deposited on single crystalline MgO(100)  substrates at room temperature by the laser ablation technique using Ar-F  excimer pulse laser.  The laser beam with an energy of 60-80 mJ/pulse was  operated at a repetition rate of 35 pulses per second and focussed on the surface of a  target by a quartz lens system.  The target was prepared as follows:  (1)  Each powder of Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SrCO<sub>3</sub>, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and CuO was weighed with a stoichiometric atomic ratio of BSCL (x=0.3) and the four kinds of powder were mixed in ethyl alcohol; (2) After drying the mixed powder, it was calcined at  820 °C for 10 h and furnace-cooled.  At the process of raising the temperature  a pause was made at 800 °C for 2 h; (3) After pulverizing the calcined sample,  the powder was pressed and formed into a disk of 30 mm in diameter and 5 mm in thickness.  This disk was sintered at 845 °C for 25 h and furnace-cooled.  At the process of raising the temperature a pause was made at 800 °C for 2 h.  As-deposited films were obtained after about 1.5 h of irradiation in vacuo of  about (1.3 mPa = 10<sup>-5</sup> torr) and then processed in O<sub>2</sub> gas flow of about  300 cm<sup>3</sup>/min as follows:  (i) The temperature was raised from 600 °C to 820 °C in 8 h and held at this temperature for one hour.  (ii) Then it was  raised to 850 °C in 2 h and held at this temperature for 1 h. (iii) The sample was finally furnace-cooled to room temperature... The crystalline  thin films had a preferred c-axis orientation perpendicular to the surface of the substrate.""<br>

            <strong>Notes:</strong> ""The starting Ba-Ca-Cu-O films were prepared by the metalorganic deposition  (MOD) method as follows.  The percursor solutions were prepared by mixing the  constituent metal naphthenates of Ba, Ca and Cu (molar ratio of 2:2:3) in  toluene.  These solutions were deposited onto one-face-polished SrTiO<sub>3</sub>  (100) substrates by the spin-coating technique.  After supplying enough  precursor solution to cover the substrate, the spin-coating machine was  started with a spinning rate of 5000 rpm and an acceleration time of 0.1  seconds.  The sample was spun for 10 seconds.  Then these samples were heated  at 500 °C for 10 minutes in air.  These spin-coating and heating processes  were repeated 10 times to form 1-µm-thick Ba<sub>2</sub>Ca<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>y</sub> films... postannealing in Tl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> vapor atmosphere was applied to make them  superconducting.  The films were sandwiched between two Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O pellets  (molar ratio of Tl:Ba:Ca:Cu=1:2:2:3) and calcined in a sealed crucible at  800-900 °C.  The films were placed on an alumina boat to separate them from  the pellets.  The films annealed at lower temperatures and longer annealing  time were the single (1223) phase and exhibited high critical current  densities.""<br>

        <strong>Notes:</strong> The authors cite A. Shah et al., Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 57, 1452 (1990), and summarize their procedure as follows. ""The precursor solution is a  stoichiometric, aqueous solution of nitrates of Bi, Sr, Ca, and Cu, with a concentration of 0.0575M based on calcium.  The solution is ultrasonically  atomized and injected into the plasma with oxygen as the carrier gas.  The  carrier gas flow rate is usually 3.7 L/min.  In this case, the plasma is operated at atmospheric pressure between power levels of 4.5-5.0 kW.  The  plasma is sustained with a 1:1 argon-oxygen gas flow ratio and a total flow  rate between 12-15 L/min.  The MgO (100) single-crystal substrate, 12 x 5 mm  in dimension, is mounted on a stainless-steel block, heated by four 150 W  cartridge heaters.  The heater block is heated to a temperature of 700-730 °C  (depending on the required superconducting phase), as measured by a K-type  thermocouple embedded in the block.  As the block is immersed in the plasma,  the temperature of the substrate rises further by about 100-150 °C.  The  droplet size of the atomized nitrate solution ranges from 1 µm to 4 µm, with the  particle residue ranging from 0.1 µm to 0.3 µm.  The aerosol is injected into  the plasma where it evaporates and the vapor deposits on the substrate.  The  deposition is completed in 5-10 min.  Film thickness is usually 0.05-0.2 µm.  This is a deposition rate of about 100-200 σ/min.  The aerosol injection is shut off after deposition and the film is further exposed to the argon-oxygen  plasma for 3-5 min at the operating rf power levels.  Subsequently, the film is naturally quenched down to room temperature in a flowing oxygen ambient of 3 L/min.""<br>

Initial alkaline earth carbonated and CuO reactants were dried by heating at 400 °C for 7 h.  The BaCuO<sub>2</sub> was prepared by sintering a mixture (99.99% purity) of BaCO<sub>3</sub> and CuO in an alumina cell using the schedule 885 °C for 10 h, ramping to 975 °C over 24 h, and holding at 975 °C for 24 h.  The Ca<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>3</sub> and CuO mixture (99.99%) purity) in a stepped manner  using 885 °C, 920 °C, 950 °C, and 975 °C sinterings for 24 h each with  intermediate grindings.

The powder was then pressed into pellets and sintered in  a covered gold boat placed in a alumina tube in a series of heating stages with intermediate weighings, grindings, and pressings. The samples were  sintered at 925 °C for 3 h, 890 °C for 48 h, 900 °C for 15 h, and 890 °C for 60  h.  The first sintering was performed under a positive oxygen pressure of  about (133 kPa = 1000 torr), and the products were the Tl-2223 and Tl-2212  phases. Subsequent heatings to produce Tl-1223 were performed under a  positive oxygen pressure of about (33 kPa = 250 torr)... The tape was fabricated by the oxide powder in tube process.  The Tl-1223 powder was  ground with a mortar and pestle for 0.5 h prior to loading into a silver  tube (6.35 mm OD x 4.35 mm ID x 10 cm long) that had been previously welded closed at one end. The silver tube had been thoroughly cleaned by swabbing  with methanol followed by drying... The remaining tube end was then pressed  and welded closed.

            <strong>Notes:</strong> ""A Questek KrF laser operating at 248 nm (8-25 ns, 10 Hz) was used for  ablation.  The laser beam was focused onto the target to an area of 5 x 2  mm<sup>2</sup> giving rise to a fluence of 1.8 J/cm<sup>2</sup>.  The target was rotated at  1/2 Hz and the laser spot was rastered on the target to get a large area of  uniform deposition.  The starting target composition was 2.6:2:2:3.  The  powders were mixed in stoichiometric ratios and ball milled for 8 h.  The  mixed powders were calcined at 800 °C (30 h.) followed by ball milling and  pellets of (2.54 cm = 1 in) diameter were prepared by pressing at (138 MPa =  2000 psi). The targets were sintered in oxygen at 840 °C for 12 h.  Hot  pressing at (69 MPa = 10000 psi) was done in an inert atmosphere at a  temperature of 780 °C for 1 h. No oxygen annealing was performed on the hot  pressed targets and hence they were expected to be oxygen deficient.  Single  crystal (100) MgO substrates were used in this study.  The substrates were  cleaned by sonicating in methanol for 15 min.  The substrate temperature was  measured using a type S thermocouple mounted at the back of the substrate  holder. Prior to deposition, the target was cleaned by 200 shots of the  laser.  The chamber was pumped down to (0.13 mPa = 10<sup>-6</sup> torr) base  pressure and film deposition was carried out in (27-93 Pa = 200-700 mtorr) of  oxygen.  The typical film thickness were (about) 8000 σ.  The oxygen pressure  in the chamber was raised from (27 Pa = 200 mtorr) to (93 Pa = 200 mtorr)  after deposition and the films were cooled to room temperature in 20 min.""<br>

Synthesis was accomplished in 4 h  at 800 °C by exposure to pure oxygen of reduced total pressure.  The 123 was  mixed by mortar and pestle with 1, 5 or 10 mol% tetragonal ZrO<sub>2</sub> particles  (composition 97 mol% ZrO<sub>2</sub>, 3 mol% Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; average particle size about 0.8  µm). Various concentrations of 211 were also added to the 123 or 123-ZrO<sub>2</sub>  mixtures.  The 211 was synthesized in air by solid-state reaction at 950 °C.  Bar specimens were cold pressed and sintered for 6 h in flowing oxygen at temperatures from 910 °C to 950 °C... Some bars were annealed in oxygen at  425 °C for 10 h to convert the tetragonal 123 to the superconducting  orthorhombic phase.

The mixture  is melt in an alumina crucible at 1040 °C for 24 h, rapidly cooled to 970 °C  and then slowly cooled (1.5 °C/h) to 830 °C before reaching RT by switching off  the furnace...

Crystal growth is performed in a gold tube inserted in a silica ampoule  sealed under dried oxygen and placed in a vertical tube furnace.  The ampoule  is heated to 730 °C by 150 °C/h, held at this temperature for 24 h before  rising up to 950 °C by 50 °C/h.

The  flux of the ion beam was arbitrarily limited to 2 x 10<sup>8</sup> ions cm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>  in order to avoid warming effects during irradiation.  The crystals were  irradiated along their smallest direction i.e. the c-axis, within an angle  resolution of about 5° from it.

The oxygen-content has been estimated from lattice parameters and T<sub>c</sub> to be x = 6.93 ± 0.05, the density of the pellet being about 90%. All investigated samples came from this pellet by cutting off little bars with the size 1.2 x 1.2 x 7mm<sup>3</sup>.  Each of these bars had to undergo an individual adjustment of the oxygen content by annealing it in air at a constant temperature between 400 °C and 700 °C for 24 h followed by a rapid quench in liquid N<sub>2</sub>... the bars were stored after the quench for several days at room temperature. The oxygen content of the bars has been determined by the weight-change caused by the oxygen adjustment.  The accuracy of this method was estimated to be ±0.02... All oxygen contents... are related to the pellet... which gives an additive uncertainty in the oxygen content.""<br>

The substrates are unheated and no oxygen is supplied to the deposition chamber; the entire process is carried out in vacuum (0.1-1 mPa = 10<sup>-5</sup>-10<sup>-6</sup> torr)... the targets were obtained by mixing and mechanically grinding high purity powders of BaF<sub>2</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and CuO in the metal ratios Y:Ba:Cu=0.8:3.0:2.5. After mixing, the powders were pressed into circular disks (25 mm diameter) under (69 MPa = 10000 psi) and then heated in dry oxygen at 800 °C for 8 to 12 h to improve mechanical stability... The substrates were (001)SrTiO<sub>3</sub>... polished disks... Substrate preparation consisted of ultrasonic baths of acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and distilled water, followed by blow-drying with compressed nitrogen.  Finally, the clean substrates were heated to 1000 °C in dry oxygen for 1 h.  The film depositions were performed using a KrF excimer laser... operating at a wavelength of 248 nm and a repetition rate of 10 Hz.  The laser output energy was continuously monitored and held constant.  The laser beam was focused to a 1x2 mm<sup>2</sup> size on the target, yielding an incident energy density of 1 J/cm<sup>2</sup> pulse.  The target was rotated slowly (0.2 rpm) in order to ablate uniformly from its entire surface.  Substrates were positioned 3 to 5 cm away from the target, resulting in a deposition rate of 3 σ/s.  After deposition, the films were transferred to a quartz tube furnace.  The annealing schedule, which usually required 7 h from start to finish, consisted of a 45 min ramp from 25 °C to peak temperature (PT), a hold a PT for various intervals, followed by a 2 h ramp down to 440 °C to 25 °C over a period of about 3 h.  For this investigation, the peak temperatures were varied from 825 °C to 875 °C and the hold times at PT ranged from 30 to 120 min.  The heating and holding portions of this annealing schedule were carried out in the presence of flowing wet oxygen, while the cooling was performed in flowing dry oxygen...""<br>
